# ncar_python_tutorial
Working through the tutorial from Pythia/NCAR to get a better understanding of this content.

A few notes:
-This tutorial is from here https://ncar.github.io/python-tutorial/tutorials/yourfirst.html#using-a-built-in-package
-Some notes are in the files themselves.
-Some notes are in my computer setup file (personal Word document ComputerSetup_Dellp7560Comprehensive2OnGoing.docx).
-Some notes are here.

The folder named jupyter_tutorial is used for a separate tutorial. 

A few notes on the jupyter lab.
-You can create your own kernels for custom python environments (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSzXvwzFsDU @ 52:00)
- Go to (activate) another conda enviornment (conda activate some_other_env)
- if needed, conda install ipykernel  (this will make this OTHER env findable as kernel)
- conda deactivate
- conda activate jupyter_tutorial
- conda install nb_conda_kernels    (this will allow THIS evn to look for other evns that have ipykernel installed)

- start juypter lab again
- jupyter lab

Now, he can see all envs with ipykernel in the Notebook console.
